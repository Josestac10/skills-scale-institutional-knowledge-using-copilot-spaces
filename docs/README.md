## Brief Overview of Project Management Processes

- **Initiation:** Align stakeholders, define goals, success metrics.
- **Planning:** Break down work, estimate effort, prioritize backlog, and establish the Definition of Done.
- **Execution:** Maintain regular rhythms (daily/weekly), observe PR conventions, track progress, and ensure testing.
- **Risk Management:** Continuously identify, mitigate, and escalate risks.
- **Release:** Complete pre-release checks, follow deployment checklist, utilize rollback playbook if needed.
- **Retrospective:** Review learnings, celebrate wins, and drive continuous improvement.
